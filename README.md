# Desk Controller

Desk controller is a gadget that connects to my pc and can:
- control a bias lighting system
- control a desk led strip

The bias lighting is the most complex part of this whole system.
The setup consists of a WS2815 12V led strip mounted around my main monitor, which is controlled by the STM32C0 of the desk controller by bit-banging the RGB data.
The RGB data is computed by a Visual C++ application running on windows and sent to the desk controller via serial port.
The main challenge here was to make a fast enough algorithm to to compute the RGB data, for the bias lighting to be reactive I wanted to achieve a 30Hz refresh rate of the RGB data, which means updating the leds color at most every 0.33.. seconds.
Without getting into GPU shaders and such, the wastest way to capture a screenshot of the screen and calculate the average color for the sections of the screen around the border, was to use the Desktop Duplication Windows API.

I inted too use this feature only during gaming or watching films, which I only do on windows. A Linux-equivalent application can always be made at a later moment,
